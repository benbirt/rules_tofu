"""Build-time `tofu init -backend=false` + `tofu validate` for a materialized
work tree.

The deploy rule (and the library's auto-emitted validating deploy) call
`tf_init_validate(...)` to attach a validate stamp to the rule's outputs, so
`bazel build :foo` exercises validation in the build graph (with caching).

`-plugin-dir` is always passed (pointing at the sibling plugin tree that
`materialize_plugin_tree(...)` declares), so init is offline regardless of
whether `required_providers` is declared. With zero providers in scope the
plugin tree has no files, so the action falls back to an empty directory and
init is still a no-op for provider installation.

When providers come from `tf_providers.from_lock`, the workspace's lock is
copied next to the configuration (after the check that refuses a lock in
`srcs`/`data`), so init fails when the configuration's version constraints
no longer match it, and checks the vendored packages against its hashes.
