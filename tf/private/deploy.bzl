"""`tf_deploy` rule + macro.

The macro always emits:
  - `:<name>`         — the `_tf_deploy` data target. Its outputs are
                        the materialized working tree (a symlink-mirror of
                        every transitive .tf input at its workspace-relative
                        path, plus a generated `rules_tofu.auto.tfvars.json`),
                        a validate stamp produced by running
                        `tofu init -backend=false && tofu validate` at build
                        time, and (when `var_files` is non-empty) a stamp
                        produced by a duplicate-variable-key check across
                        `vars` and every `var_files` entry. So
                        `bazel build :<name>` exercises both checks.
  - `:<name>.plan`    — runnable: `bazel run :<name>.plan`
  - `:<name>.apply`   — runnable: `bazel run :<name>.apply`
  - `:<name>.destroy` — runnable: `bazel run :<name>.destroy`
  - `:<name>.fmt`     — runnable: `bazel run :<name>.fmt`

When `fmt_test=True` (the default) and `srcs` is non-empty:
  - `:<name>.fmt_check`  — test: `bazel test :<name>.fmt_check`

Materialization happens at analysis time via `ctx.actions.symlink` (one
action per file). At runtime the runner cd's into the work tree and
invokes `tofu init && tofu <plan|apply>` against it. Nothing is
mktemp'd; nothing is symlinked from bash.

    """A root OpenTofu/Terraform configuration, with targets to plan, apply and destroy it.

    Always generates:
      - `:<name>`         — data target. Building it materializes the work tree
                            and runs `tofu init -backend=false && tofu validate`
                            against it, so `bazel build :<name>` validates.
      - `:<name>.plan`    — `bazel run` to produce a plan.
      - `:<name>.apply`   — `bazel run` to apply.
      - `:<name>.destroy` — `bazel run` to destroy all managed resources.
      - `:<name>.fmt`     — `bazel run` to reformat .tf files in-place.

    When `fmt_test=True` (the default) and `srcs` is non-empty:
      - `:<name>.fmt_check` — `bazel test` that fails if files are not formatted.

    Args:
      name: target name.
      srcs: optional deploy-local .tf files (e.g. provider/backend config).
      deps: `tf_library` targets to compose.
      vars: dict of variable name -> value, rendered to rules_tofu.auto.tfvars.json.
      var_files: `.tfvars.json` or `.tfvars` files passed to tofu with `-var-file`.
          Any label works, e.g. a genrule output. Keys must not overlap with
          `vars` or other `var_files` entries; a duplicate key fails
          `bazel build`.
      data: arbitrary files to include in the work tree, enabling `file()` calls
          in Terraform configs.
      providers: providers (`@tf_providers//<namespace>/<name>`, from the
          `tf_providers` extension in MODULE.bazel) declared at the deploy
          level, in addition to those its `deps` bring in. `tofu init` runs
          offline against them.
      allow_ephemeral_state: allow `:<name>.apply` and `:<name>.destroy` to run
          against local state. A deploy with no `backend "..." {}` or `cloud {}`
          block keeps its state at
          `bazel-bin/<pkg>/<name>.rules_tofu-state/terraform.tfstate`, which is
          machine-local, forks with the build configuration, and is deleted by
          `bazel clean` — losing it orphans whatever was applied. So by default
          the runner refuses both mutating commands for such a deploy; `plan` is
          never gated. Set True only where disposable state is the point: demos
          and examples, throwaway sandboxes, or bootstrapping the bucket that
          will hold real state (then move it with
          `tofu init -migrate-state` once the backend block is in place).
          Ignored when a backend/cloud block is present.
      fmt_test: whether to emit a `:<name>.fmt_check` test target. Only emitted
          when True (the default) and `srcs` is non-empty.
