"""Resolution of the single OpenTofu version the toolchain extension pins.

Split out of `extensions.bzl` so the decision is a pure function that
//toolchain/tests can exercise without evaluating a module graph. Problems
are reported as an `error` string on the returned struct rather than raised
with `fail()`: a `fail()` inside this helper would be unobservable from a
Starlark test, and the extension is the only caller entitled to abort the
build. The rules themselves are documented in `extensions.bzl`.
