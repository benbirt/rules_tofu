# Negative integration tests

Bazel-in-Bazel tests that assert misuses of `tf_library` /
`tf_deploy` fail with the error messages the rules promise.

```

`lock_update/` and its driver `lock_update_test.sh` are the one positive
test: a workspace's first `@tf_providers//:pin`, with the provider already
named in a BUILD file, then a provider update made the way Dependabot or
Renovate makes it (`versions.tf` and `.terraform.lock.hcl` only, from
`bumped.lock.hcl`), which must build with `--lockfile_mode=error` and leave
`MODULE.bazel.lock` unchanged.

`broken_workspace` shares one `MODULE.bazel` across all of its cases, so a
case whose failure lives in the module graph cannot go there — it gets a
sub-workspace of its own. `BUILD.bazel` names the workspace per case row
and globs each workspace's files once.

The child workspace packages are excluded from the parent Bazel via
the `--deleted_packages` flag in `.bazelrc` (the "deleted packages"
trick recommended by `rules_bazel_integration_test`), so the outer
Bazel never analyzes the intentionally-failing case targets when
expanding `//...`.

## Case lists

`BUILD.bazel` holds two lists, distinguished only by the nested Bazel
command the driver runs:

- `_CASES` — build-mode cases. The failure comes from loading,
  analysis, or one of the actions the rules emit, so `bazel build` on
  the case target is enough to surface it. This is the driver's
  default, so these rows set no `BAZEL_COMMAND`.
- `_RUN_CASES` — run-mode cases, with `BAZEL_COMMAND: "run"` in `env`.
  The case target builds cleanly and the refusal comes from the
  launcher process a `tf_deploy` generates. These are the only tests
  that exercise the path from a BUILD attribute through the generated
  launcher to a runner flag; the runner's own Go unit tests pass flags
  directly and cannot see that plumbing.

## Running

```sh
bazel test //tests/integration:all
```

Each test spawns a nested Bazel that materializes the case's work tree
and runs `tofu init/validate` (or the dupcheck action), or — for a
run-mode case — launches the deploy's runner; the driver checks the
failure mode.

## Adding a case

1. Create `broken_workspace/cases/<case>/` with a `BUILD.bazel` that
   misuses the rules, plus any fixture files the failure mode needs.

   If the misuse is in the *module graph* rather than in a BUILD file —
   extension tag resolution, a bad `bazel_dep`, a `use_repo` mismatch —
   it cannot live in `broken_workspace`, whose single `MODULE.bazel` is
   shared by every case. Add a new sub-workspace alongside it (see
   `broken_module/`) with its own `MODULE.bazel`, a `.bazelversion`
   byte-identical to the root one, and a case package holding whatever
   target forces the broken part to be evaluated. Module extensions are
   lazy, so check empirically that the target you pick actually triggers
   the failure. Register the new workspace in `_WORKSPACE_FILES`.
2. Add a row to `tests/integration/BUILD.bazel`:
   `("<case>", "<workspace>", "//cases/<case>:<target>", "<stderr-fragment>")`.
   Put it in `_CASES` if `bazel build` on the target fails, or in
   `_RUN_CASES` if the target builds and only `bazel run` fails — the
   latter comprehension passes `BAZEL_COMMAND=run` to the driver.
3. Execute `bazel run @rules_bazel_integration_test//tools:update_deleted_packages`
   to add the new package to `--deleted_packages` in the root `.bazelrc`.

Pick a stderr fragment short and stable enough not to break on tofu /
rule-error wording tweaks; avoid quoting full sentences.

## Follow-ups

All core build-time negative failure modes are covered, as is one
runtime mode: the ephemeral-state refusal on `bazel run :deploy.apply`
when the deploy has no backend and has not opted in.

Still untested end-to-end: the opt-in direction (a deploy that sets
`allow_ephemeral_state = True`, or declares a backend, reaching tofu),
`bazel run :deploy.plan` outside the Bazel environment, and
`tf_providers` module-resolution errors. These can be addressed in
future testing passes if needed.
